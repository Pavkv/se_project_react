# WTWR Front-End

WTWR (What to Wear) is a weather-based clothing recommendation app. The **front-end** of this project is a modern, responsive, and interactive React application that connects with a RESTful back-end server to authenticate users, manage user profiles, and allow users to create, view, and interact with weather-related clothing items.
